# Drowsy-Driver-Prevention
Demonstrating the powerful life-saving potential of modern computer vision technology when applied to the ongoing problem of fatigued drivers drifting off to sleep at the wheel (causing an estimated 328,000 accidents annually), using just a USB webcam. Whilst my work serves primarily as a proof of concept of what can now be achieved at costs that significantly undercut anything presently available on the market that shares the same purpose, I do also go on to discuss methods in which this approach could be taken from prototype to fruition as a consumer-ready product.
